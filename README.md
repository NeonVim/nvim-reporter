# Neovim Configuration

I use <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> as my primary editor. This repository contains my configurations, including key mappings, plugins, and other settings and tools that make me more productive.

I've committed this to Github in an attempt to help others get up-and-running with the tool.
