# Quickstart

1. `git clone https://github.com/harrisoncramer/neovim-settings.git ~/.config/nvim`
2. `:PackerSync` (You will see errors on initial startupâ€“this is to be expected, because we don't have the plugins installed yet. You may need to run PackerSync a couple of times).

# About 

I use <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> as my primary editor. This repository contains my configurations, including key mappings, plugins, and other settings and tools that make me more productive.

Some of the highlights:
- Native LSP w/ <a href="https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter">treesitter</a>
- LSPs via <a href="https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer">lsp-installer</a> and configured w/ <a href="https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig">lspconfig</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/numToStr/FTerm.nvim">fterm</a> for terminal integration
- <a href="https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim/issues">telescope</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim">diffview</a> integrated w/ telescope for git history/diffs
- <a href="https://github.com/samoshkin/vim-mergetool">vim-mergetool</a> for merges
- Tim Pope's <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">fugitive</a> for commits (and his other plugins)
- <a href="https://github.com/akinsho/bufferline.nvim">bufferline</a> for buffer views
- <a href="https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim">lualine</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim">gruvbox</a> colors scheme

# Dependencies

Some of these packages require other external dependencies that must be installed.

1. <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>
2. <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>
3. <a href="https://github.com/neovim/pynvim">pynvim</a>
4. Tree Sitter and Neovim
5. Node (I'd recommend using <a href="https://github.com/Schniz/fnm">fnm</a>)

Finally, the language server for volar expects to use a global installation of Typescript, rather than a local one in your project. I've done this because you may be working in Javascript files, but still want Volar to work. You must therefore pass an environment variable to your nvim startup to tell the LSP where to look, for instance, inside my `.zshrc`, I have the following:

```
function v() {
  TS_SERVER='/Users/harrisoncramer/.fnm/node-versions/v16.13.0/installation/lib/node_modules/typescript/lib/tsserverlibrary.js' nvim
}
```
