# TODO

# Immediate
- Automatically add all merge conflicts to the quickfix list (or some similar functionality)
- Write custom function to create file in Telescope's git_files (grab current state from Telescope's state/actions)
- Write custom function to delete file in Telescope's git_files 

# Long-term
- Figure out what's causing the LSP slowdown in v0.7
